# authdemo
A project showing user authentication using Passport
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This project uses a library Passport.js that makes it rather easy for 
us to implement user authentication.

The project shows a /secret page that can only be accessed by logging in.
If a user isn't logged in, they will not see the secret.
